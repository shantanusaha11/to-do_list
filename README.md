# Todo app

A brief description of what this project does

A Todo app made using React and Ant Design is a web application that allows users to create a list of tasks that they need to complete. The app is built using the React JavaScript library, which enables the creation of dynamic user interfaces, and Ant Design, which is a popular UI component library for React.

The app allows users to add, edit, and delete tasks. The user interface is designed using Ant Design components, which give the app a clean and modern look.

When a user adds a new task, they can specify a title, description, due date etc.

The app also includes search and filter functionality, which allows users to easily find tasks based on keywords or specific criteria such as due date or priority level.

Overall, a Todo app made using React and Ant Design provides users with a simple and intuitive way to manage their tasks and stay organized.
